# Crime-Prediction-App
Crime has become one of the major threats to public safety across the globe. With the rise of technology, we can now predict crime patterns and help law enforcement agencies prevent crimes before they occur. This project aims to develop a Crime Prediction App using machine learning to forecast potential criminal activities based on past data.
